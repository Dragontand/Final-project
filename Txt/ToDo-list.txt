Fix This error:
timetable:1 Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
Element with focus: <button.btn-close btn-close-white ms-2>
Ancestor with aria-hidden: <div.modal fade#modal> <div class=​"modal fade" id=​"modal" tabindex=​"-1" aria-labelledby=​"modalLabel" style=​"display:​ block;​" aria-hidden=​"true">​…​</div>​
